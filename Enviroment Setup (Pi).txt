To configure from commandline
sudo raspi-config --config system
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
passwd --change password
sudo apt-get update --update OS
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo ifconfig --print network info
more /etc/network/interfaces --print network config file
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces --edit network config file
sudo nano /etc/hostname --set network name
sudo nano /etc/hosts

Ensure that you have development tools installed on your system, otherwise run the command below to install them.
-$ sudo apt install build-essential libreadline-dev

Remove lua 5.1
https://howtoinstall.co/en/ubuntu/trusty/lua5.1?action=remove
sudo apt-get remove lua5.1
sudo apt-get autoremove lua5.1

Reboot

Install lua 5.3.5
https://www.lua.org/download.html
https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/readme.html
From /home/pi
-$ curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
-$ tar -zxf lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
-$ cd lua-5.3.5
-$ make linux test
-$ sudo make install

Reboot

Install LuaRocks
From /home/pi
https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Installation-instructions-for-Unix
-$ wget https://luarocks.org/releases/luarocks-3.3.1.tar.gz
-$ tar zxpf luarocks-3.3.1.tar.gz
-$ cd luarocks-3.3.1
Run ./configure --with-lua-include=/usr/local/include. (This will attempt to detect your installation of Lua. If you get any error messages, see the section "Customizing your settings", below.)
This still found a trace of 5.1
So, i used this to force 5.3.  Output said it found 5.3.  Check location and did find lua 5.3.5 at /usr/local/bin
-$ ./configure --lua-version=5.3.5
-$ make 
-$ sudo make install

Reboot

Install libmodbus
  https://libmodbus.org/
  https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus
-$ wget https://libmodbus.org/releases/libmodbus-3.1.6.tar.gz
-$ tar zxf libmodbus-3.1.6.tar.gz
-$ cd libmodbus-3.1.6
-$ ./configure
-$ make
-$ sudo make install

Reboot

Install lua-libmodbus
http://etactica.github.io/lua-libmodbus/ -- Manual
https://luarocks.org/modules/karlp/lua-libmodbus
https://github.com/etactica/lua-libmodbus
Downloaded and unziped but could not configure file
		-$ wget https://github.com/etactica/lua-libmodbus/archive/master.zip
		-$ unzip master.zip
		-$ cd lua-libmodbus-master
		make LUAPKG=lua-5.3
		sudo make install
This worked and can call require("libmodbus") from lua command command line
-$ sudo luarocks install lua-libmodbus
Still got message that it requires lua5.1

Reboot

Install git
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/mdiz/veo_lua.git
git config ––global user.name “github_username”
git config ––global user.email “email_address”

This setup resulted in this package.path
/usr/local/share/lua/5.3/?.lua;
/usr/local/share/lua/5.3/?/init.lua;
/usr/local/lib/lua/5.3/?.lua;
/usr/local/lib/lua/5.3/?/init.lua;
./?.lua;
./?/init.lua

Where do lua scripta go?
I put them in /usr/local/share/lua/5.3/.
Info seems to suggest they should go in opt

8/21/20 lua-libmodbus is working well but can not read 32 bit floating values.
Going to try python with a pipe to lua

Install Python
Install uModbus - looks like good docs and eludes to 32 bit floating ability
Other package to consider is pymodbus.  Docs are extensive and very confusing.  It's a huge package with lots of capability.

Note from python docs regarding package installations:
Note Due to the way most Linux distributions are handling the Python 3 migration, Linux users using the system Python without creating a virtual environment first should replace the python command in this tutorial with python3 and the pip command with pip3 --user. Do not run any of the commands in this tutorial with sudo: if you get a permissions error, come back to the section on creating virtual environments, set one up, and then continue with the tutorial as written.









Information Collected:


lsusb --list USB connected devices
dmesg --ran this and got a LOT of info.  Found where it said "FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0"
so use /dev/ttyUSB0 as USB device

Modbus is 0 based so, depending on driver, will need to subtract 1 from register number listed to get proper response value

Modbus Register Addressing
	There are a few points about Modbus register addressing that can cause confusion.
	● In the Modbus specification, register numbers are documented as “one based”, but transmitted as “zero based”. For example, we document that EnergySum appears at address 1001.
	If you are using any Modbus software or Modbus aware device, you should use “1001” as the
	register address. However, if you are writing your own low-level Modbus driver or firmware,
	you will need to subtract one from the register number when creating the Modbus frame (or 
	Operating Instructions 33
	packet), so the actual register number that appears on the RS-485 bus will be “1000” (or in
	hexadecimal, 0x03E8).
	● A common Modbus convention adds the function code as a leading digit on the register
	number, so a register like EnergySum (1001) would be documented as 41001. All input registers (function code 04) would use the form 4xxxx, while holding registers (function code 03)
	would use the form 3xxxx. The WattNode meter treats holding registers and input registers
	interchangeably, and does not use this convention. If your Modbus software expects a leading “3” or “4”, either will work for most registers, and use “3” for configuration registers.






Need good lua editor for raspberry pi
